This is my final exam in my 2 year Frontend Development education.


Description
In this project I reached out to a real world client that needed a new website for their hair salon. The main objective is a website to tell the client where to contact them, make an appointment, find opening hours and where to find them. And as a part of the exam I also needed to make an admin page where you can log in and make changes to the services and employees. For this I have used WordPress as a headless CMS.
